# Cybersecurity & Cloud Security Portfolio üõ°Ô∏è‚òÅÔ∏è

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity and Cloud Security Portfolio**! This repository contains all the projects, research, and hands-on exercises I complete during my 3-month journey to becoming proficient in cybersecurity and cloud security engineering.

The goal is to build a comprehensive portfolio that showcases my skills, knowledge, and practical experience in securing systems, networks, and cloud environments. Each week focuses on specific topics, ranging from basic cybersecurity principles to advanced cloud security practices.

## Week 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity and Cloud Computing

### Overview
In Week 1, we cover the foundational concepts of cybersecurity and cloud computing. Topics include:
- **Cybersecurity Basics**: CIA Triad, common threats (e.g., Malware, Phishing, Ransomware).
- **Cloud Computing Models**: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
- **Networking Fundamentals**: IP addresses, DNS, firewalls, ports, and protocols.

### Projects
- **Day 1**: Research and analysis of a recent cybersecurity breach (e.g., Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack).
- **Day 4**: Hosting a personal blog on AWS using WordPress and securing it with HTTPS. [Coming Soon]

## Week 2: Operating Systems and Security Basics

### Overview
In Week 2, we dive into operating system security, focusing on Linux and Windows. Topics include:
- Linux basics: Commands, file permissions, users/groups.
- Windows security features: User Account Control (UAC), BitLocker.
- Virtualization: Docker, VirtualBox/VMware.

### Projects
- Setting up a virtual machine (VM) using VirtualBox or VMware.

## Week 3: Networking Fundamentals

### Overview
In Week 3, we explore networking concepts such as the OSI model, TCP/IP stack, and common network protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH, DNS). We'll also use tools like Nmap and Wireshark for network scanning and traffic analysis.

### Projects
- Using Nmap to scan local networks and identify open ports.
- Capturing and analyzing HTTP traffic with Wireshark. [Coming Soon]

## Week 4: Introduction to Cloud Platforms

### Overview
In Week 4, we introduce cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Topics include:
- AWS basics: EC2, S3, IAM.
- Azure basics: Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, RBAC.
- Google Cloud basics: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage.

### Projects
- Deploying a static website on AWS S3.
- Setting up an Azure VM and configuring firewall rules.
